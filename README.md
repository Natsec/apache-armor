## Should I harden my webserver ?

Check by yourself at [observatory.mozilla.org](https://observatory.mozilla.org).

## Requirements

To launch this role, you will need :

- Ansible
- SSH access to your server (key-based authentication is better)
- root, or any user with sudo privilege ðŸ™‚
- Any major Linux distribution

## Usage

The role edits a temporary copy of you configuration file, then backup and overwrite your original configuration file if changes were made.

>You can start by testing your webserver configuration on [observatory.mozilla.org](https://observatory.mozilla.org).

Install Ansible, then create the following `apache_hardening.yaml` playbook :
```yaml
- name: Hardening playbook
  hosts:
    production:
      ansible_host: www.example.org
      #ansible_user: user
      #ansible_password: user_pass

  become: yes

  roles:
    - Apache-Armor
```

You should have the following arborescence :
```bash
tree

```

Finally, launch your playbook with :
```bash
ansible-playbook apache_hardening.yaml
```

Now you can [check your webserver](https://observatory.mozilla.org) again and enjoy the improvement ðŸ˜Ž.
